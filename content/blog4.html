        <p>Monsoons make the world look divine the rain-kissed trees shine, all renewed in their lush greens while
            the fragrance of wet earth kicks in the nostalgia and brings some lovely moments back to memory! Here
            are some places where the monsoons will have an even dreamier effect on you.

        <p>An artists' village, this quaint little hill town in Gujarat is fondly known as the Kashmir of the West,
            after the rains. This little metaphor is an analogy to the stunning beauty that enshrouds the place,
            with natural waterfalls, creeping vines, and lush greenery all around. The food native to this region is
            known to be very nutritious and simple. Decent low-cost accommodation, coupled with handmade, artsy
            souvenirs made by locals make Saputara a perfect monsoon getaway.</p>

        <p>Wake up and smell the coffee‚Äù will have a new meaning for you, once you step into Coorg! Waking up to the
            sight of lush green coffee plantations while sipping a homegrown, fresh brew in the rains will instill a
            different level of happiness in your soul. Add to this some homegrown chocolate and cheese brands in the
            vicinity and you're in for a treat! Despite being a popular tourist destination, Coorg has remained
            untouched owing to its remoteness. You can take a road trip from Mysore or Bangalore in the rains that
            will make it worth your while!</p>
